Array - a contiguous memory space. Contiguous means unbreaking memory space which contains a certain amount of bytes.

a = int[3]
a[0] - What you're telling the computer to do is, go to the memory address of A. Then add in the offset of zero multiplied by how big my type is. Because if your type is 32 bits or four bytes, index one has to be four bytes into the array or into the memory space.
